## Running the code
Run the command `yarn dev` in the cmd in the same directory as the Next.js project, and the development server will be started up. Go to `localhost:3000` (or whatever port it is using, it'll be printed out in the cmd). You will now be able to see your code updates live as you make them. If for some reason your change isn't happening, try resetting the page.
